Instagram Follow Checker

This script helps you identify users you follow on Instagram who don't follow you back. It processes JSON files exported from Instagram and compares your followers vs. following lists.

Features:

1. Loads Instagram follower and following data from JSON files.
2. Extracts usernames from a nested JSON structure.
3. Compares both sets to find users who donâ€™t follow you back.




Export your Instagram data manually:

1. Go to Settings > Your Activity > Download Your Information and request a JSON format download.
2. Extract relevant data: Since the JSON format may vary, ensure that you extract and format the data correctly before using the script.
3. Place the formatted JSON files in the script directory.
4. Run the script


Results:
The script will display users who donâ€™t follow you back.
If everyone follows you back, it will notify you. ðŸŽ‰



If File Not Found: Make sure the necessary JSON files are present and correctly named before running the script.
